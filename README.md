# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Our Goal

The objective was to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. We can create awesome designs for App using Flutter. 


## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling. 

## What we did

- Used Flutter themes to create coherent branding. 
- Created multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- Extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button. 
- Pass functions as parameters and fields.
- Used the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
- Used Enumerations to simplify Gender.
- Used custom colour palettes by using hex codes.
- Customised Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
- Understand Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
- Composition vs. inheritance and the Flutter way of creating custom UI.
- Difference between const and final in Dart and when to use each.
